# duke3d-map2stl-js
A really broken port of map2stl by Ken Silverman

MAP2STL.ZIP (9,494 bytes, 05/15/2009): A utility for converting Build .MAP files to .STL format (simple triangle soup). This may be useful for small test programs, although not much else since all texture and color information is lost during the conversion.(Win32)

As of right now, this version converts a build engine .map file into "Simple Triangle Soup" but in text form. It's not really meant for directly exporting. I wanted to get build engine maps into exportable geometry and step 1 was porting Ken Silverman's original C code into JavaScript. Next up is figuring out what this code actually does...
